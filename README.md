Murat's Tic Tac Toe Game Project
In this first project I have ever developed by myself, I developped a single page(spa) application website for 'the tic tac toe' game. Tic tac toe is a generic game for two players. In my website two people can play together as Player X and Player O. Only the registered user is allowed to play the game. As soon as this user signed in, s/he can see the previous games and total games played as well.

Technologies
In this project, I used jQuery, AJAX, JavaScript, HTML and CSS technologies.

Development
First, I created my game board and i added my user interface. Sign In, Sign Up,
Sign Out and Change password features. When my user interface fully worked i started
to c create my game logic. And finalliy i added GAME API which provides user based
game statics.
